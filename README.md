**Executive Summary**: a web-based tool under the belt of freelance developers for tracking projects and managing finances meticulously. It can help a developer estimate when the work will be completed and the cost by showing the amount of work remaining over time. CodeCount is especially useful for short-term projects like the ones ALX students engage in regularly as it is an excellent way to represent your progress against time visually.
